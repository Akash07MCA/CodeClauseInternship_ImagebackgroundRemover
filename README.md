# CodeClauseInternship_ImagebackgroundRemover
The Image Background Remover project aims to develop a web-based tool that allows users to effortlessly remove backgrounds from images. This tool will provide a simple and intuitive interface for uploading images, applying
background removal algorithms, and downloading or sharing the edited images.This Project was part of my CodeClause Internship.
